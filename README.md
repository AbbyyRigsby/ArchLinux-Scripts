# ArchLinux-Scripts
Personal repository of scripts used on my Arch Linux build, including package installs for fresh builds.

Hey there! This repository is made for my personal Arch Linux build, including scripts to install arch linux as out-the-box as possible. This is likely also where I'd store my dot-config files for hyperland and quicksilver.
